# Duelyst-Launcher

Simple Duelsyt launcher for linux based on https://gist.github.com/anonymous/23fb19c7f5e455147b6528f6bafdbbc7

Put the file into the folder where you want to install duelyst and launch it (you must have run the command "npm i electron-packager -g" before)

It will add a launcher to the menu and update the game when needed
